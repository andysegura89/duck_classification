# duck_classification
I created this application for a research group I'm in. 
This app is designed to use a convolutional neural network to give predictions on duck species. 
This was coded in the summer of 2022. I had no previous training on flutter or dart. 
This was all coded with help from man pages, youtube videos, and stack overflow. 
I mostly worked on the application, but I did contribute to the training of the models. 
The models themselves are protected under intelectual property laws.
